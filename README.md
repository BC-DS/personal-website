## What's a user story?
Software engineers use the term 'user story' to refer to the features the users want. That helps engineers see the development process from the users' point of view. Therefore, in our projects, we call the requirements/features user stories.  

A sample user story: "User can navigate the site from the hyperlinks in the _navigation bar_"
Meaning: As a developer, this user story tells you to develop a navigation bar with hyperlinks to different parts of the website. 

## Required User Stories:
- [ ] User can navigate the site from the hyperlinks in the _navigation bar_
- [ ] The site is divided into following sections: bio (about), skills, experience, projects, contact info (feel free to rename these or add more sections)
- [ ] User can get to know you reading your bio in the bio section
- [ ] User can click a button to view/download your resume (this could be in the bio section)
- [ ] User can see _at least_ one picture (e.g. profile picture) (this could be in the bio section)
- [ ] User can find your technical and soft skills in the skills section
- [ ] User can access your GitHub and/or LinkedIn profiles through hyperlinks and your email address (this could be in the contact info section)
- [ ] (optional) Footer
